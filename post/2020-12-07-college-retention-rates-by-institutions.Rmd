When I began taking this class, I was unsure about what I would be learning since I am not really good with coding. Although I still would not consider myself literate in coding, I feel like I learned enough basics to get by. I am really grateful I took this class and have been able to create something as cool as my own website.

```{r}
library(reticulate)
hist(iris$Sepal.Length, xlab="Sepal Length (cm)", main= "Distribution of Iris Sepal Length", right = F, col = "blue")
"This blog has been"-> rcode
```


```{python}
pyth= "great fun"
print(r.rcode,pyth)
```
